# Dagster Pipes Tests

This is a "golden" test suite for the Dagster Pipes protocol. It is designed to test the protocol implementation in various languages, ensuring that the protocol is implemented correctly and consistently across all them.

# Usage

To make use of this test suite, it has to be installed as a Python package.

The package is a `pytest` plugin which provides various fixtures and utilities for testing Pipes.

TODO: Add more information on how to use the test suite.
